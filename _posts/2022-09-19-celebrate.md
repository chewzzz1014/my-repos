I've complete introductory course on [jekyll-github-pages-tutorial](https://github.com/chewzzz1014/jekyll-github-pages-tutorial) and it's my turn to make my own github pages.

I always want to make sure that all my repositories are well-organized by providing their respesctive link and description. Dumping all the infos on my profile's READ.md like I previously did is definitely not a good idea, considering how painful it is (at least for me) to read them :rofl:. Thus, I've decided to move my repositories' info on this github pages. Hopefully, this page will be maintained and improved from time to time while I learn more about jekyll.
